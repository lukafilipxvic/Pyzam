        Inserts an invisible container into your app that can be used to hold
        multiple elements. This allows you to, for example, insert multiple
        elements into your app out of order.

        To add elements to the returned container, you can use "with" notation
        (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See
        examples below.

        Examples
        --------
        Inserting elements using "with" notation:

        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> with st.container():
        ...    st.write("This is inside the container")
        ...
        ...    # You can call any Streamlit command, including custom components:
        ...    st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(50, 3))
        ...
        >>> st.write("This is outside the container")

        .. output ::
            https://doc-container1.streamlitapp.com/
            height: 520px

        Inserting elements out of order:

        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> container = st.container()
        >>> container.write("This is inside the container")
        >>> st.write("This is outside the container")
        >>>
        >>> # Now insert some more in the container

        """Insert containers laid out as side-by-side columns.

        Inserts a number of multi-element containers laid out side-by-side and

        To add elements to the returned containers, you can use "with" notation
        (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See
        examples below.

        Columns can only be placed inside other columns up to one level of nesting.

        .. warning::
            Columns cannot be placed inside other columns in the sidebar. This is only possible in the main area of the app.

        Parameters
        ----------
        spec : int or iterable of numbers
            Controls the number and width of columns to insert. Can be one of:

            * An integer that specifies the number of columns. All columns have equal
              width in this case.
            * An iterable of numbers (int or float) that specify the relative width of
              each column. E.g. ``[0.7, 0.3]`` creates two columns where the first
              one takes up 70% of the available with and the second one takes up 30%.
              Or ``[1, 2, 3]`` creates three columns where the second one is two times
              the width of the first one, and the third one is three times that width.

        gap : "small", "medium", or "large"
            The size of the gap between the columns. Defaults to "small". This
            argument can only be supplied by keyword.

        Returns
        -------
        list of containers
            A list of container objects.

        Examples
        --------

        Inserts a number of multi-element containers as tabs.

        .. warning::

            Conditional rendering is currently not supported.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tabs : list of strings
            Creates a tab for each string in the list. The first tab is selected by default.
            The string is used as the name of the tab and can optionally contain Markdown,
            supporting the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code,
            Emojis, and Links.

            This also supports:

            * Emoji shortcodes, such as ``:+1:``  and ``:sunglasses:``.
              For a list of all supported codes,
              see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.

            * LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$"
              must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed
              at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.

            * Colored text, using the syntax ``:color[text to be colored]``,
              where ``color`` needs to be replaced with any of the following
              supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet.

            Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render.
